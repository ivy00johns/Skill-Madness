# Output Format Specification

This file is a schema reference for `skill-review` output. It is read by the skill at runtime and by `skill-update` to parse the JSON sidecar. It is not an actual review.

## Output File Names

| Mode | Markdown artifact | JSON sidecar artifact |
|------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| A (`--scope=all`) | `skill-review-report.md` at the repo root (or a user-specified path) | `skill-review-report.json` next to it |
| B (`--scope=<name>`) | `{skill-path}/skill-review-report.md` | `{skill-path}/skill-review-report.json` |

## Mode A Markdown Template

The Mode A run fills in the template below. Keep the section order stable so downstream tooling can locate sections.

```markdown
# Ecosystem Review Output
Reviewed: [ISO-8601 timestamp]
Scope: all  (or: filtered description)
Skills scanned: [count]

## Executive Summary
- Total skills: X
- Passing: X (X%)
- Issues found: X (X critical, X high, X medium, X low)
- Ownership conflicts: X

## Skill Inventory
| Skill | Category | Version | Desc Length | Body Lines | Refs | Status |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|------------|------|--------|

## Ownership Map
[Tabular representation of which agent owns what]

### Conflicts
[Any overlaps detected — empty if none]

## Description Quality Ranking
| Rank | Skill | Score | Issues |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
[Weakest first]

## Bulk Issues

### Frontmatter Violations
| Skill | Field | Issue |
|-------|-------|-------|

### Progressive Disclosure Violations
| Skill | Body Lines | Issue |
|-------|------------|-------|

### Cross-Skill Issues

## Coverage Gaps
[Capabilities referenced in `CLAUDE.md`, the orchestrator's `references/file-ownership.md`, or the orchestrator phase-guide that no existing skill covers]

## Recommendations
[Top 5 highest-impact improvements, ordered by priority. For each, name the skill(s) involved and the suggested action.]

## Per-Skill Scores
| Skill | Frontmatter | Description | Disclosure | Consistency | Overall |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|---------|
[PASS / WARN / FAIL per column. Details available via `--scope=<name>` follow-up.]
```

## Mode B Markdown Template

```markdown
# Single-Skill Review Output: [skill-name]
Reviewed: [ISO-8601 timestamp]
Skill path: [path]
Why-now: [optional — the user-supplied context]

## Summary
| Dimension | Score (1-5) | Issues |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Frontmatter compliance | X | Y |
| Description quality | X | Y |
| Progressive disclosure | X | Y |
| Instruction clarity | X | Y |
| Coordination | X | Y |
| Completeness | X | Y |
| Anti-patterns | X | Y |

**Overall score:** X.X / 5.0
**Verdict:** SHIP | NEEDS WORK | MAJOR REWORK

## Trigger Testing
- Should-trigger hit rate: X/Y (Z%)
- False-positive rate: X/Y (Z%)
- Problem triggers: [list any that failed]
- Skipped: [reason, if skill-creator was unavailable]

## Issues

### [SEVERITY]-[N]: [Title]
- **Dimension:** [which]
- **Location:** [file:line or frontmatter field]
- **Description:** [what is wrong]
- **Suggestion:** [how to fix]

## Strengths
[What the skill does well — specific examples]

## Recommendations
[Prioritized list of improvements, ordered by impact]
```

## JSON Sidecar Schema

`skill-update` consumes the JSON sidecar. Both modes emit the same top-level shape; the `mode` field disambiguates and only the relevant sub-block is populated.

    }

}
```

Allowed enum values:

- `mode`: `all` | `single`
- `status`: `PASS` | `WARN` | `FAIL`
- `severity`: `critical` | `high` | `medium` | `low`
- `verdict`: `SHIP` | `NEEDS WORK` | `MAJOR REWORK`

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| critical | Skill cannot function (missing frontmatter, broken YAML, no description) |
| high | Skill works but likely under-triggers, has ownership conflicts, or violates ecosystem rules |
| medium | Functional but missing references, weak descriptions, or minor anti-patterns |
| low | Style nits and polish |

## Handoff to skill-update

`skill-update` reads `skill-review-report.json` and converts each entry in `issues` into a proposed edit. The `id`, `skill`, `dimension`, `location`, and `suggestion` fields are the contract — keep their names stable across versions.
