# Deep Review Rubric

Scoring criteria for each dimension evaluated in Mode B (`--scope=<skill-name>`). Each dimension is scored 1–5 with concrete evidence.

## Scoring Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Excellent — no issues, exemplary |
| 4 | Good — minor issues, fully functional |
| 3 | Adequate — works but has clear gaps |
| 2 | Needs work — functional issues or significant gaps |
| 1 | Major rework — fundamentally broken or missing |

## Dimension: Frontmatter Compliance

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | All required fields present, all types correct, version valid semver, optional fields used appropriately |
| 4 | All required fields present and correct, minor optional field issues |
| 3 | Required fields present but some formatting issues (e.g., description too long, version not semver) |
| 2 | Missing a required field or significant type errors |
| 1 | Frontmatter absent, malformed YAML, or multiple required fields missing |

Check:

- `name`: kebab-case, ≤64 chars, unique across ecosystem. `claude-` / `anthropic-` prefixes trigger a WARN (not FAIL); acceptable when the skill targets the corresponding Anthropic product and documents the exception.
- No `<` or `>` anywhere in the frontmatter block
- `version`: valid semver (X.Y.Z), top-level
- `description`: present, multiline YAML string, ≤1024 chars
- Agent roles: `owns.directories`, `owns.patterns`, `owns.shared_read` present
- `allowed-tools` (hyphen): appropriate for the skill's function. `allowed_tools` (underscore) accepted as deprecated alias
- `compatibility`: present if the skill has host/tool/env requirements
- `metadata`: nested object form if used
- `composes_with`: lists real skill names
- `spawned_by`: accurate if declared
- `argument-hint`: present if the skill takes an argument

## Dimension: Description Quality

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Action verb, 3+ trigger contexts, keyword variants, appropriate length, would reliably trigger |
| 4 | Good trigger coverage, minor gaps in keyword variants |
| 3 | Triggers for obvious cases but misses edge-case phrasings |
| 2 | Too vague ("helps with X") or too narrow (only triggers for exact phrases) |
| 1 | Missing, single-word, or would never trigger |

Check against description-patterns:

- Starts with an action verb
- Under 400 characters (target; the host's skill listing is budgeted)
- Contains ≥3 specific trigger contexts
- Includes keyword variants users might say
- States exclusions if commonly confused with another skill
- Specific enough to beat its neighbors: a few phrases users really say, not an exhaustive list

## Dimension: Progressive Disclosure

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Body <2,000 words and <300 lines, references well-organized, clear pointers, TOC for large refs |
| 4 | Body ≤5,000 words and ≤500 lines, references used, pointers present |
| 3 | Body approaching the 5,000-word / 500-line guideline, some content could move to references |
| 2 | Body >5,000 words OR >500 lines without clear justification, or references exist but aren't linked |
| 1 | Everything in one massive file, or references broken/missing |

Note: heavy skills (`orchestrator`, `ui-ux-pro-max`, `repo-deep-dive`) earn length and should not be penalized below 3 for size alone — score them on whether the length is actually load-bearing.

Check:

- SKILL.md body line count
- Detailed checklists, templates, and tables live in `references/`
- Body links to references with "when to read" guidance
- Reference files >300 lines have a table of contents
- No duplicate content between body and references

## Dimension: Instruction Clarity

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Clear imperative steps, logical flow, explains reasoning, would guide any LLM correctly |
| 4 | Clear steps, mostly logical, minor ambiguities |
| 3 | Understandable but requires interpretation, some steps vague |
| 2 | Confusing flow, contradictory instructions, or steps that assume unstated context |
| 1 | Incoherent, missing process, or instructions that would mislead |

Check:

- Imperative voice ("Read the file" not "The file should be read")
- Steps numbered and ordered logically
- Explains WHY, not just WHAT
- Avoids excessive MUST / NEVER without rationale
- An LLM following these steps would produce the right output

## Dimension: Coordination

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | Ownership clearly declared, no overlaps, composes_with accurate, handoff points defined |
| 4 | Ownership clear, minor coordination gaps |
| 3 | Ownership declared but some ambiguity, composes_with partially accurate |
| 2 | Ownership overlaps with existing skills, or coordination rules missing for agent role |
| 1 | No ownership declaration for agent role, or conflicts with multiple existing skills |

Check (for agent roles):

- `owns.directories` don't overlap with other agents
- Directory ownership follows precedence rules (v1.1 resolved conflicts)
- `composes_with` lists correct collaborators
- Off-limits sections clearly stated
- Handoff protocol defined if needed

Check (for non-agent skills):

- `composes_with` accurately reflects actual composition
- Inputs and outputs documented for pipeline integration

## Dimension: Completeness

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | All referenced files exist, validation checklists complete, examples thorough |
| 4 | All references resolve, minor gaps in examples |
| 3 | Most references resolve, some dead links or missing examples |
| 2 | Multiple dead links or missing referenced files |
| 1 | Referenced files don't exist, no examples, critical sections missing |

Check:

- Every file path mentioned in SKILL.md exists
- Every reference file is linked from the body
- Validation checklists (for agent roles) have specific commands
- At least one example provided for key operations
- Templates referenced are actually present

## Dimension: Anti-Patterns

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5 | No anti-patterns detected |
| 4 | One minor anti-pattern |
| 3 | 2–3 anti-patterns, none critical |
| 2 | Multiple anti-patterns including some that affect functionality |
| 1 | Pervasive anti-patterns that undermine the skill |

See `audit-checklist.md` §Anti-Pattern Checklist for the full list.

## Verdict Thresholds

| Verdict | Criteria |
|---------|----------|
| **SHIP** | Average ≥4.0, no dimension below 3, trigger hit rate ≥80% |
| **NEEDS WORK** | Average ≥3.0 or 1–2 dimensions below 3, trigger hit rate ≥50% |
| **MAJOR REWORK** | Average <3.0 or 3+ dimensions below 3, or trigger hit rate <50% |
