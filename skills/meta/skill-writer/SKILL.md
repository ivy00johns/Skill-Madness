  Generate new SKILL.md files conforming to the ecosystem's frontmatter spec and structure conventions. Use when creating a new agent role, meta skill, workflow skill, or contract skill — anything that needs a SKILL.md scaffold. Trigger on "create a skill", "new agent", "write a SKILL.md", "scaffold a skill", "add a role to the skill ecosystem".

# Skill Writer

Generate correctly structured SKILL.md files for the Claude Code skill ecosystem. Every skill follows the same frontmatter convention and directory structure.

## When to Use

- Creating a new agent role skill
- Creating a new workflow or meta skill
- Reviewing existing skills for spec compliance
- Adding a role to an orchestrated build

## Skill Directory Structure

```text
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required — frontmatter + instructions
└── references/           # Optional — loaded on demand
    └── detailed-guide.md
```

## Progressive Disclosure

Skills use three-level loading:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens) — name + description, always in context
2. **SKILL.md body** (≤5,000 words; soft warning at 500 lines) — loaded when skill triggers
3. **References** (unlimited) — loaded on demand via explicit reads

Keep SKILL.md bodies concise. Move detailed checklists, templates, and reference tables to `references/` with clear pointers.

## Creating a New Skill

### Step 1: Choose the Skill Type

| Type | Directory | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Agent role | `roles/{name}/` | Implementation agent for orchestrated builds |
| Meta skill | `meta/{name}/` | Tools for the skill ecosystem itself |
| Workflow | `workflows/{name}/` | Cross-cutting processes |
| Contract | `contracts/{name}/` | Integration contract management |
| Orchestrator | `orchestrator/` | Lead coordinator (singleton) |

### Step 2: Write the Frontmatter

Every SKILL.md starts with YAML frontmatter. See `references/frontmatter-spec.md` for the complete field reference.

Required fields:

- `name` — kebab-case, max 64 chars. `claude-*` / `anthropic-*` prefixes are reserved by Anthropic; use them only as a documented exception when the skill targets the corresponding Anthropic product (e.g., `claude-design-brief`).
- `version` — semver (start at 1.0.0), top-level
- `description` — `[What] + [When] + [Capabilities]` anatomy (≤200 chars target, 1024 hard ceiling)

The description is the primary trigger mechanism. Write it "pushy" — enumerate contexts where the skill should activate. See `references/description-patterns.md` for templates and the 3-slot anatomy.

### Step 3: Write the Body

Structure the body around:

1. **Role statement** — one paragraph defining what this agent/skill does
2. **Inputs** — what parameters it receives
3. **Process** — numbered steps, imperative voice
4. **Coordination rules** — how it interacts with other agents
5. **Guidelines** — principles and common pitfalls

For agent role skills, also include:

- **Step 0: Read Contracts** — every role skill should start by reading contracts and domain rules before any implementation
- **Ownership** — directories/files owned exclusively, with note that orchestrator prompt takes precedence over frontmatter defaults
- **Off-limits** — what this agent must never touch
- **Right-sizing** — guidance on adapting to project complexity
- **Validation** — link to `references/validation-checklist.md`

### Step 4: Create Reference Files

Move detailed content to `references/`:

- Validation checklists with specific commands
- Templates and examples
- Detailed technical guides
- Tables longer than 20 rows

Reference files from the body with guidance on when to read:

```markdown
For the complete validation procedure, read `references/validation-checklist.md`
before reporting done.
```

### Step 5: Validate the Skill

- [ ] Frontmatter has all required fields
- [ ] `name` is kebab-case. If it starts with `claude-` or `anthropic-`, that's a documented exception (skill targets the corresponding Anthropic product)
- [ ] No `<` or `>` anywhere in frontmatter
- [ ] Description is ≤200 chars (target) and "pushy"; never exceeds 1024 chars (ceiling)
- [ ] Body is ≤5,000 words (soft warning past 500 lines)
- [ ] File ownership doesn't overlap with existing agents (check v1.1 resolved conflicts)
- [ ] Directory ownership takes precedence over pattern ownership
- [ ] Reference files are linked from the body
- [ ] No duplicate content between body and references

## Common Mistakes

- **Vague descriptions** — "Helps with backend stuff" won't trigger. Be specific.
- **Body too long** — Approaching 5,000 words or 500 lines? Move content to references.
- **Missing ownership** — Agent roles must declare owned and off-limits files.
- **Overlapping ownership** — Two agents can't own the same directory. Directory ownership takes precedence over pattern ownership (see `references/frontmatter-spec.md` §Ownership Resolution Rules).
- **Ignoring resolved conflicts** — Check `references/frontmatter-spec.md` §Resolved Conflicts (v1.0 → v1.1) before declaring ownership of `contracts/`, `.claude/handoffs/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, or `tests/performance/`.
- **Hardcoded project details** — Global skills never change per project. Use profile.yaml.
