# Playwright Setup & Configuration

## Installation Check

Run these checks in order. Stop at the first success.

### 1. Check if @playwright/test is installed

```bash
npx playwright --version 2>/dev/null
```

If this returns a version (e.g., `1.52.0`), Playwright is installed. Skip to browser check.

### 2. Check if Chromium browser is available

```bash
npx playwright install --dry-run 2>&1 | grep -i chromium
```

Or simply try launching:

```bash
node -e "
const { chromium } = require('playwright');
(async () => {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  console.log('Chromium OK:', browser.version());
  await browser.close();
})().catch(e => { console.error('FAIL:', e.message); process.exit(1); });
"
```

### 3. Full Installation

If Playwright isn't installed at all:

```bash
# Ensure package.json exists
npm init -y 2>/dev/null

# Install Playwright test framework
npm install -D @playwright/test

# Install Chromium browser binary
npx playwright install chromium

# On Linux, also install system dependencies
npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

### 4. TypeScript Support

If the project uses TypeScript (check for `tsconfig.json`), Playwright's test runner handles `.ts` files natively. For standalone scripts, ensure `tsx` is available:

```bash
npx tsx --version 2>/dev/null || npm install -D tsx
```

## Playwright Configuration

If the project doesn't have a `playwright.config.ts`, you don't necessarily need one — tests can be run with CLI flags. But if the project has one, respect its settings and only override what's needed for screenshots. If you do edit an existing config, edit it in place — don't leave a `playwright.config.ts.bak` behind; that stray backup is exactly the kind of clutter this skill avoids.

### Minimal Config for Screenshot Runs

When you need a config (e.g., for custom viewports or multiple projects), keep every artifact under the single `.playwright/` root by overriding the two paths Playwright otherwise writes to the project root (`outputDir` defaults to `./test-results`, the HTML reporter to `./playwright-report`):

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  outputDir: '.playwright/artifacts',                                  // traces/videos (default: ./test-results)
  reporter: [['html', { outputFolder: '.playwright/html-report', open: 'never' }]], // default: ./playwright-report
  timeout: 30_000,
  expect: { timeout: 5_000 },
  fullyParallel: false, // sequential for predictable screenshots
  use: {
    headless: false,
    screenshot: 'on',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    baseURL: process.env.BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:3000',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'desktop',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], headless: false },
    },
    {
      name: 'tablet',
      use: { ...devices['iPad Pro 11'], headless: false },
    },
    {
      name: 'mobile',
      use: { ...devices['iPhone 14'], headless: false },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Responsive Testing Viewports

Standard viewport set for responsive checks:

| Name | Width | Height | Device Scale |
|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Desktop | 1920 | 1080 | 1 |
| Laptop | 1366 | 768 | 1 |
| Tablet | 1024 | 768 | 2 |
| Mobile | 375 | 667 | 3 |

Use `page.setViewportSize()` to switch between them during a single test, or configure separate Playwright projects for each.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `BASE_URL` | Target application URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `SPOT_CHECK` | Enable slow-motion for interactive review | unset |
| `PW_TIMEOUT` | Global test timeout (ms) | `30000` |

## Troubleshooting

### Browser won't launch

**Symptom:** "Browser closed unexpectedly" or "Failed to launch chromium"

**Fix:** Install system-level dependencies:
```bash
npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

On macOS, this is rarely needed since Playwright bundles its own Chromium. On Linux (especially Docker/CI), it's almost always required.

### Sandbox errors on Linux

**Symptom:** "No usable sandbox" or "Operation not permitted"

**Fix:** Disable sandbox (development/testing only — never in production):
```typescript
const browser = await chromium.launch({
  headless: false,
  args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'],
});
```

### Page loads but screenshots are blank

**Symptom:** Screenshots are all white or show partial content

**Fix:** Wait for the page to fully render:
```typescript
await page.goto(url);
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
// For SPAs, also wait for a known element:
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="main-content"]');
await page.screenshot({ path: screenshotPath });
```

### Timeout waiting for selector

**Symptom:** Tests time out looking for elements that should exist

**Common causes:**
1. Element is inside an iframe — use `page.frameLocator()`
2. Element is lazy-loaded — increase timeout or wait for a network event
3. Selector is wrong — use Playwright Inspector to verify: `npx playwright codegen <url>`
4. SPA routing hasn't completed — wait for `page.waitForURL()`

### Port conflicts

**Symptom:** "Address already in use" when starting the test server

**Fix:** Check what's on the port before starting:
```bash
lsof -i :3000 | grep LISTEN
```

Kill if needed, or configure a different port via `BASE_URL`.

## Generating Tests with Codegen

Playwright's codegen is useful for quickly scaffolding test scripts:

```bash
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000
```

This opens a browser and records your interactions as Playwright test code. Useful for creating initial test scripts that you then refine.
