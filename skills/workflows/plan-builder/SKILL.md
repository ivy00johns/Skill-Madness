version: 1.4.0
description: |
  Transform research documents, Compass artifacts, PRDs, and conversational goals into structured project plans the orchestrator can execute. Use when the user has source material plus a build request, says "make a plan" / "plan this out", or @-mentions files alongside a build ask. Also trigger when orchestrator would be the next step but no plan exists yet. Produces the plan — orchestrator consumes it.

# Plan Builder

> **Tradeoff:** Biases toward thoroughness over speed. For simple changes that don't need a plan, skip directly to implementation.

## When this skill applies

This skill assumes a contract-first multi-agent build model:

- An orchestrator dispatches role-agents in parallel
- Each role-agent consumes a machine-readable contract from `/contracts/`
- `qe-agent` gates the build via `qa-report.json`

For single-agent or ad-hoc work, this skill is not the right tool.

## What to do

Transform source material and project goals into orchestrator-ready build plans.

The orchestrator is powerful but needs a well-structured plan to work from. This skill bridges the gap between "I have research and a vision" and "orchestrator, go build it." It handles the thinking that should happen *before* agents are spawned: synthesizing source material, making architectural decisions, mapping content to components, and producing a plan the orchestrator can immediately act on.

**Announce at start:** "Using plan-builder to create a structured project plan."

## When This Skill Runs vs Others

- **Brainstorming** explores what to build when the idea is vague. It asks many questions, one at a time, to refine intent. If you arrive here with only a vague idea and no source material, invoke brainstorming first, then come back with the spec it produces.
- **Plan-builder** (this skill) synthesizes known inputs into a build plan. It works when you have source material, a clear goal, or a spec from brainstorming. It asks at most 3 clarifying questions before producing a draft — bias toward action.
- **Writing-plans** produces TDD-level implementation detail (exact file paths, test code, commit messages) for single-agent sequential execution. Plan-builder produces architecture-level plans for multi-agent parallel execution.
- **Orchestrator** consumes the plan this skill produces. It sizes teams, authors contracts, and spawns agents.
- **Living-plan** is for *maintaining* an existing plan over time — a front door, a tactical ledger, and a report-intake loop so work stays tracked instead of rotting. Use plan-builder (this skill) to *create* a plan from source material once; use living-plan when the project already has a plan and you need to keep it alive as new reports and work items arrive.

## Entry Detection

Assess what the user has brought:

| Signal | Entry Path |
|--------|-----------|
| @-mentioned files, attached docs, research artifacts, Compass exports | **Path A** — Artifact Ingestion |
| Spec from brainstorming, PRD, requirements doc | **Path A** — treat as artifact |
| Clear goal but no artifacts ("build me a dashboard for X") | **Path B** — Goal-Driven |
| Vague idea, no artifacts ("I want to do something with AI") | **Redirect** → invoke brainstorming |
| Existing codebase + new source material | **Path A+** — Augmentation variant |

## Path A: Artifact Ingestion

When the user provides research documents, Compass artifacts, or reference material alongside a build request, follow the four-step extraction in `references/research-extraction.md`:

1. **Synthesize source material** — content domains, natural sections, data points, implied features, volume
2. **Map content to architecture** — produce a source-to-component table; research-heavy projects need information architecture before code architecture
3. **Check existing codebase (Path A+)** — only if working in an existing project; respect existing conventions
4. **Confirm with user** — present the content map + key decisions concisely; ask at most 3 clarifying questions total

Then produce the plan (see `references/plan-format.md`).

## Path B: Goal-Driven (No Artifacts)

When the user has a clear goal but no source material:

1. Ask: **What are you building, who is it for, and are there constraints?** (tech stack, timeline, existing code, deployment target). This is one question — don't split it into three messages.
2. If the answer is still vague after one round, invoke brainstorming rather than asking more questions. Plan-builder is for synthesis, not ideation.
3. If the goal is clear enough to plan, proceed straight to plan production.

## Behavior Rules

- **Reasoning first, plan second.** Always produce Section 1 (Architecture Reasoning) before Section 2 (Build Plan). Thinking through the *why* produces better plans than jumping straight to the *what*.
- **Surface ambiguity, don't bury it.** If source material is contradictory or a decision could go either way, say so in Architecture Reasoning. Silent assumptions become integration bugs.
- **Bias toward action.** Three clarifying questions maximum. After that, draft the plan and let the user correct it. A wrong draft you can fix is more useful than a perfect question you haven't asked yet.
- **Right-size for orchestrator.** Plans should be specific enough that the orchestrator can size teams and author contracts, but not so detailed that agents have no autonomy. Component responsibilities yes, implementation pseudocode no.
- **Flag scale.** If the plan would require more than 6 parallel agents, suggest phasing: build the core in phase 1, extend in phase 2. Large teams need proactive context management (handoffs, phased spawning) to maintain quality.
- **Trace second-order effects for consequential decisions.** When a decision affects systems beyond the immediate build scope or has a time horizon longer than 30 days, apply the **second-order-effects** move (`references/second-order-effects.md`) before finalizing that section of the plan.
- **Respect existing code.** When augmenting an existing project, follow its conventions. Don't propose a React rewrite of a Vue app just because you prefer React.

## Handoff

After the plan is saved:

> "Plan saved to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>-plan.md`. Ready to build?"
>
> - **Orchestrated build:** I'll invoke the orchestrator skill to spawn the agent team
> - **Solo build:** I'll invoke writing-plans to expand this into TDD implementation steps
> - **Review first:** Take a look at the plan and let me know what to change

Wait for the user's choice. Do not auto-invoke the orchestrator.

## Anti-Pattern

> **Forbidden:** Padding the plan with phases for the sake of structure. If three steps suffice, write three steps.

## Supporting Info

### Reference Documents

- **`references/plan-format.md`** — the section-by-section structure of the plan document (Architecture Reasoning + Build Plan, with templates for each section).
- **`references/research-extraction.md`** — how to pull a plan out of research docs (synthesize, map to architecture, check existing code, confirm with user).
- **`references/second-order-effects.md`** — thinking move for tracing downstream ripple consequences of a plan decision (use when the decision scope extends beyond 30 days or touches shared systems).

### Output Location

Save the plan to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<project-name>-plan.md` unless user preferences override the location.
