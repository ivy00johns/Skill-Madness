  Create expert-quality mermaid diagrams — flowcharts, sequence, state, ER, Gantt, mindmap, block-beta and more — including dense 15-30+ node architecture maps that stay readable. Use whenever the user wants to visualize a system, process, workflow, architecture, data model, timeline, or relationship, or when another skill needs an embedded mermaid diagram. Trigger on "diagram this", "draw this", "show me how X works", "map the architecture", "chart the flow", "visualize this", or any request for a technical visual — even without the word "mermaid".

# Mermaid Charts

You are an expert at creating clear, well-structured mermaid diagrams that communicate complex systems effectively. Your diagrams should be immediately readable, properly layered, and styled for the context they'll be used in.

## Core Principle: Diagrams Are Arguments

A diagram isn't a picture — it's an argument about how a system works. Every element should earn its place. Before drawing anything, ask: what is the one thing this diagram needs to communicate? Then ruthlessly cut everything that doesn't serve that point.

A diagram of a three-layer architecture should make the layers obvious. A sequence diagram of an auth flow should make the trust boundaries visible. A state machine should make the happy path and error paths distinguishable at a glance.

## Choosing the Right Diagram Type

Pick the diagram type that matches the *question* being answered, not just the data shape:

| Question | Diagram Type | Reference |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| "How does data/control flow through this?" | `flowchart` | `references/chart-types/flowchart.md` |
| "What talks to what, in what order?" | `sequenceDiagram` | `references/chart-types/sequence.md` |
| "What states can this be in?" | `stateDiagram-v2` | `references/chart-types/state.md` |
| "What are the entities and relationships?" | `erDiagram` | `references/chart-types/er.md` |
| "How do these concepts relate?" | `mindmap` | `references/chart-types/mindmap.md` |
| Classes, Gantt, block-beta, timeline, pie, journey, gitGraph | various | `references/chart-types/other.md` |

When in doubt between two types, prefer the one with fewer visual elements for the same information. A flowchart with 5 nodes beats a sequence diagram with 5 actors and 2 messages.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the question.** State the one thing the diagram must communicate.
2. **Pick the chart type.** Use the table above. Read the relevant `references/chart-types/*.md` for syntax recipes and examples.
3. **Sketch the layout.** Pick direction (TB/LR/BT/RL), identify subgraphs and grouping boundaries.
4. **Draft the diagram.** Use shapes and edges to encode meaning consistently.
5. **Style purposefully.** See `references/styling.md` for `classDef` usage, color discipline, and contrast rules.
6. **Verify against the checklist below** before delivering.

## Managing Complexity

For diagrams above ~10 nodes, ecosystem maps, or multi-diagram document structure, read `references/complexity-and-output.md`. It covers:

- Visual hierarchy (glance/scan/study levels) for 15-30 node diagrams
- Multi-diagram strategies and when to split vs keep together
- Ecosystem map patterns for 10+ interconnected systems
- Output format (markdown, `.mmd` files, rendered SVG/PNG via `mmdc`)
- Common pitfalls (special chars, label lengths, subgraph collisions, keyword IDs)

## Advanced Patterns

For sophisticated needs — multi-diagram document structure, complex flowcharts with 15-30+ nodes, sequence patterns, `block-beta` system maps, theming/branding, the full rendering pipeline — read `references/advanced-patterns.md`.

## Sharing a diagram as a hosted page

To hand someone a *link* to a diagram rather than a code block or an image file, render the diagram to SVG, inline that SVG in a self-contained HTML page, and pass it to `artifact-publish` for a hosted, default-private claude.ai page. Inline the **rendered SVG** — do not load `mermaid.js` from a CDN in the page, since the Artifact CSP blocks external scripts.

## Checklist Before Delivering

- [ ] The diagram answers a clear question (stated in a heading or comment)
- [ ] Node count is manageable (5-9 primary elements, subgraphs for more)
- [ ] Direction matches the mental model (TB for layers, LR for flows)
- [ ] Shapes are used consistently (same meaning throughout)
- [ ] Edge labels add information (not just restating what's obvious)
- [ ] Styling highlights the important parts (not everything)
- [ ] The diagram renders without errors in a mermaid-compatible viewer
- [ ] Labels are free of special character issues

## Reference Files

- `references/chart-types/flowchart.md` — direction, subgraphs, shapes, edges, large-system architecture, anchor pattern, multi-system comparison patterns
- `references/chart-types/sequence.md` — actors/participants, activate/deactivate, control flow blocks
- `references/chart-types/state.md` — start/end states, transitions, composite states
- `references/chart-types/er.md` — cardinality notation, key attributes
- `references/chart-types/mindmap.md` — root shape, hierarchy by indent
- `references/chart-types/other.md` — class, Gantt, block-beta, timeline, pie, journey, gitGraph; when NOT to diagram
- `references/styling.md` — `classDef`, color rules, contrast, color-by-concern
- `references/complexity-and-output.md` — visual hierarchy, multi-diagram strategy, ecosystem maps, output formats, pitfalls
- `references/advanced-patterns.md` — read when the guidance above isn't enough; covers multi-diagram document structure, complex flowcharts, theming/branding, rendering pipeline (350+ lines of detailed patterns)
