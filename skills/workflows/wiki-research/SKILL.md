  Read the project's Obsidian-style wiki (index.md + wiki/) BEFORE any codebase exploration, repo-deep-dive, or raw source reading. Reading 3-4 wiki pages (~2,000 tokens) typically replaces crawling raw source directories (~100,000-500,000 tokens). Always invoke when orchestrator, a role agent, or code-review needs project context, architecture, component knowledge, or design decisions before touching files. Trigger on "how does X work", "understand the architecture", "review this code", or "build X" when project context matters. Skip only for purely mechanical tasks (rename a variable, fix a typo) where zero project understanding is needed.

# Wiki-First Research Protocol

An Obsidian-style wiki is a compiled, cross-linked knowledge base synthesized from raw source material. Reading it is an order of magnitude cheaper than re-reading raw sources — and faster than re-deriving understanding the hard way.

## Why Wiki-First

| Source | Typical token cost | When to use |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| `index.md` scan | ~300–600 tokens | Always — find what's covered |
| 1 wiki entity/concept page | ~300–800 tokens | Targeted knowledge |
| 1 wiki source page | ~600–1,500 tokens | Provenance + raw doc locations |
| 1 raw source directory (10–14 docs) | ~30,000–200,000 tokens | Only when wiki gaps exist |
| Full codebase exploration | 200,000–500,000+ tokens | Last resort |

Reading the wiki index + 3 pages costs roughly the same as scanning a single mid-sized source file. It almost always covers what you need.

## Step 1 — Detect the Wiki

Check if a wiki exists before doing anything else:

```bash
# Fast check: does wiki structure exist at the project root?
ls index.md wiki/ 2>/dev/null | head -5

# Or check CLAUDE.md for a wiki path declaration
grep -i "wiki" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null | grep -i "path\|root\|location" | head -3
```

If the wiki lives outside the current working directory (a separate research repo, a sibling directory), the project's `CLAUDE.md` should declare the wiki root — see "Pointing at an external wiki" below.

If no wiki exists → skip this protocol entirely and proceed with normal exploration.
If a wiki is found → continue.

## Step 2 — Read index.md

`index.md` is the navigation layer. It contains one-line summaries of every wiki page, organized by category. Reading it takes seconds and tells you exactly which pages are relevant — don't skip this.

Look for entries matching:
- The systems/components your task involves (entities)
- The patterns/principles that apply (concepts)
- Any known source collections you'd otherwise re-read (sources)

## Step 3 — Read Targeted Pages (2–4 pages max)

Based on index.md summaries, read the pages most relevant to your task:

**Entity pages** (`wiki/entities/<name>.md`) — for specific systems, platforms, or components
**Concept pages** (`wiki/concepts/<name>.md`) — for patterns, principles, and architectural ideas
**Overview** (`wiki/overview.md`) — only if you need broad ecosystem context
**Source pages** (`wiki/sources/<name>.md`) — only if you need research provenance or raw doc pointers

Each page ends with a `## Related` section. Follow those links only if they're directly relevant — don't spider the entire wiki. Stop when your question is answered.

## Step 4 — Escalate Only When Needed

After reading targeted pages, one of three situations applies:

**Wiki covers it** → You're done. Proceed with your task using wiki knowledge.

**Wiki has a gap** (page flags "not yet documented", contradiction exists, or your specific question wasn't covered):
- When synthesizing 3+ sources, apply the **contradiction-finding** move (`references/contradiction-finding.md`) before writing your summary.
- Check the relevant source page for raw doc pointers
- Read the specific raw files identified — not entire directories
- Return to your task once the gap is filled

**Topic isn't in the wiki at all**:
- Check `CLAUDE.md` for a source map or directory pointer
- Proceed with targeted exploration (grep/glob first, not broad reads)

## Standard Lookup Cost

```text
1. Read index.md            →  ~500 tokens   (mandatory)
2. Read 2–3 targeted pages  →  ~1,500 tokens (pick relevant ones)
3. Source page if needed    →  ~1,000 tokens (optional)
──────────────────────────────────────────────
Total:  ~3,000 tokens  ←→  1 small source file
```

## Wiki Page Structure

Every page should follow this format — knowing this helps you skim efficiently:

```markdown
---
title: Page Title
type: entity | concept | comparison | source | overview
tags: [...]
sources: [...]
---

# Page Title
One-paragraph summary.         ← Read this. Usually enough.

## Sections                    ← Read what's relevant to your task.

## Related
- [[linked-page]] — why linked  ← Scan for follow-up reads.
```

The opening paragraph is often sufficient. Read sections selectively.

## Standard Wiki Directory Layout

```text
<wiki-root>/
├── index.md          ← TOC, start here always
└── wiki/
    ├── overview.md   ← Ecosystem synthesis and roadmap
    ├── entities/     ← Named systems, platforms, components
    ├── concepts/     ← Architectural patterns and principles
    ├── comparisons/  ← Side-by-side analyses
    └── sources/      ← Per-source research summaries
```

This skill assumes that layout. If a project uses a different convention (a flat `docs/` folder, GitBook, MkDocs, Docusaurus), the protocol still applies but the file paths change — read the project's `CLAUDE.md` or top-level docs index to learn the structure first.

## Pointing at an external wiki

Many projects keep their research wiki in a separate repository so source code stays clean. When that's the case, the project's `CLAUDE.md` should declare the external root, for example:

```markdown
## Wiki

This project's research wiki lives at `~/Research/MyProjectWiki/`.
- Index: `~/Research/MyProjectWiki/index.md`
- Wiki pages: `~/Research/MyProjectWiki/wiki/`
- Raw source archives: `~/Research/MyProjectWiki/sources/`
```

When a wiki is external, swap the Step 1 detection commands for `ls <wiki-root>/index.md <wiki-root>/wiki/` against the path the project declares.

## Multi-cluster wikis

A single wiki can house multiple unrelated knowledge clusters — for example, a research repo that documents one team's platform alongside another team's product. Each cluster typically has its own `index.md` section and its pages don't link across clusters. When working on a task in one cluster, restrict your reading to that cluster's pages — cross-cluster wandering wastes tokens.

If the project uses this pattern, its `CLAUDE.md` should call out which cluster contains what, with any "looks like X but is actually Y" gotchas listed up front.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Do This Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Reading raw source directories first | Burns 100k+ tokens before knowing what you need | Always check the wiki first; raw source is escalation only |
| Skipping `index.md` | You read the wrong pages and miss key context | Always start with `index.md` — it costs ~500 tokens |
| Following every `## Related` link | Token spiral; loses thread of original task | Follow only links directly relevant to current task |
| Ignoring the wiki when CLAUDE.md mentions one | Defeats the entire optimization | If wiki is declared, use it — escalate to raw source only on gaps |

## Reference Documents

- **`references/contradiction-finding.md`** — thinking move for surfacing where sources disagree before writing a synthesis (use when combining 3+ sources).
