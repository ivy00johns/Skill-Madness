# Railway Deployment

Deploy projects to Railway with proper Dockerfile, config, and multi-environment support.

## How Railway Works

Railway builds and runs your app from a Dockerfile (or auto-detects with Nixpacks). Each project can have multiple **services** (web, worker, cron) across multiple **environments** (dev, production). Railway assigns a dynamic `PORT` env var that your app must listen on.

## Prerequisites

**Railway credentials** (for GraphQL API deployments) go in the current project's repo-root `.env` file — see `.env.example` for the full list. Get your API token at https://railway.app/account/tokens.

**Railway CLI** should be installed and authenticated. Verify:

```bash
railway --version    # Should show v4.x+
railway whoami       # Should show logged-in user
```

If not installed: `brew install railway` (macOS) or `npm i -g @railway/cli`, then `railway login`.

## Deployment Approaches

Railway supports two deployment methods. Choose based on the project's needs:

### Approach 1: Railway CLI (simple projects)

Best for quick deploys, single-service apps, and projects where you want Railway to auto-detect the build.

```bash
# Link to existing project (or create new)
railway link          # Interactive — select project + environment
# OR
railway init          # Create new project

# Deploy
railway up            # Builds and deploys from current directory

# Check status
railway status
railway logs
```

### Approach 2: GraphQL API + Deploy Script (multi-service, CI/CD)

Best for projects with multiple services (web + worker), automated deployments, or when you need programmatic control. See `references/deploy-script.md` for a ready-to-use deploy script pattern.

## Setting Up a New Project for Railway

1. **Detect the stack.** Read `package.json` / `requirements.txt` / `Cargo.toml` / `go.mod` to identify language, framework, entry point, and system deps. See `references/dockerfile-recipes.md` for the full stack detection checklist.

2. **Create the Dockerfile.** Pick the recipe matching your stack — `references/dockerfile-recipes.md` has Python/FastAPI, Node.js/Express/Next.js, and Astro templates, plus Dockerfile best practices.

3. **Create `railway.toml`.** The standard template with `startCommand`, `healthcheckPath`, `restartPolicyType` is in `references/dockerfile-recipes.md`.

4. **Create `.dockerignore`.** Exclude dev deps, local DBs, build artifacts. Template in `references/dockerfile-recipes.md`.

5. **Add a health check endpoint.** Railway uses it to know when the app is ready. Python/FastAPI and Node/Express snippets are in `references/dockerfile-recipes.md`.

> **Optional fallback:** Railway prefers Dockerfile but falls back to a Procfile if present — only relevant when you can't ship a Dockerfile. See the Procfile section in `references/dockerfile-recipes.md`.

## Environment Variables, Multi-Service, Troubleshooting

For env var management (`railway variables set`), multi-service setups (web + worker on the same project), the full deployment checklist, and troubleshooting common deploy failures (build errors, crash loops, health check timeouts, 502 errors, port binding), read `references/multi-service-setup.md`.

## Reference Files
